            <h2>Gardening</h2>
            <p>Clay heavy soil can be a real pain to plant in and it takes time and/or blood, seat, and tears to break
                it up and make it viable for growth. Conditioning the soil with compost is a must. We do have wild
                animals like deer, rabbits, squirrels that love to come in for free meal and it can be a pain. </p>

            <h2>Taxidermy</h2>
            <p>I'd love to get into this hobby but there are some... difficulties that you wouldn't really face with
                your average hobbies. Learning to skin an animal for one. The delicacy required to not damage the face
                and keep as much fur (if it's a furry creature) intact can be trying.</p>

            <p> Maintaining the body in an appropriate environment is also something to be considered. Keeping it too
                cold, or too hot, or not dehyddrating it enough can lead to unusable hide. Sourcing the "materials" is
                another thing that can prove difficult depending on what you want to make. The different techniques
                required for certain animal species to try and capture the "living" look is can be EXTREMELY
                difficult... but it can also lead to really outcomes.</p>
