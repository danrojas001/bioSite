                Hi there! I'm not entirely sure why the person who made this website decided to make me his subject but
                here I am! I must be a fairly interesting person in his eye's or I'm the only one he found willing to be
                the subject of this website in the time required to get it done. There was an interview and everything
                and it made me realize I need a tad more introspection in my life. You can read all about what he
                learned in the other tabs you see at the top of the screen! Hope you enjoy the peek into my mind!
