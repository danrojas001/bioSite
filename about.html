                I come from the East Coast where I enjoy the local landscape (coastal wetlands) and flora. This interest
                in flora also extends into my fairly new hobby of gardening. I ran into some difficulties with it
                last year but am now coming at it more prepared with plans for planting, harvesting and companion
                planting (the pairing of 2 different plant types which when grown together, mutually benefit).

                In my down time I enjoy reading and have recently taken a shine to Sci-Fi as a genre. This leads me to
                one of my prouder personal achievements. The fact that I have been able to read 50 books every year for
                the past 7 years. In doing so, I has been able to read more literature books as a form of
                self-improvement even though literature is not quite my cup of tea.

                On a professional level, I have been working as a genetics lab tech for more than a few years now and
                feel that the variety of college courses I took earlier on gave me the skills required to succeed in a
                niche field. I was also fortunate enough to start my career at a non-profit organization which allowed
                me to learn other skills from the ground up.

                I do have a wide array of interests though, and also find joy in tarot card reading to help rephrase
                life questions and ponder the outcome in a meditative fashion. I would love to learn how to practice
                taxidermy. Specifically finding a form of beauty in the manipulation of dead materials to try and
                recapture life. While it is a difficult hobby to start out, some failures can be quite comical.

                Speaking about life and its difficulties, I find motivation from the adage, "this too shall pass", and
                the means in which lobsters grow to tremendous size. The 2 being related, as a lobster can only grow
                larger from feeling uncomfortable in their carapace, forcing them to molt to allow for further growth.
                Here's a little lobster knowledge for you, (<a
                    href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/are-lobsters-immortal.html">Lobster Knowledge</a>). I
                find difficulties should be seen as temporary and as an avenue for growth and self improvement. Speaking
                of difficulties, one that has challenged me is my goal of finding a way to make gluten free chicken and
                dumplings The dumpling making being the true problem. Though I have tried many ingredients, success
                eludes me *sigh* and I will have to continue hammering away at this goal.

                Finally, on a more comical note, a bit of curious information. Though I have one tattoo, and 10
                cartilage piercings, I am very afraid of needles. In my youth, I would develop a limp after receiving a
                flu shot. As an adult, this need/inclination to limp persists though I have settled for simply looking
                away during the peocedure to keep the mental limp at bay.
